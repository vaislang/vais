🔥 The @ operator makes recursive functions beautifully concise:

F fib(n:i64)->i64 = n<2 ? n : @(n-1) + @(n-2)

No need to repeat the function name. Just @.
This is what token efficiency looks like 🚀

```
⚡ Vais benchmarks (Fibonacci 35):

Vais (optimized):  48ms
Rust (release):    45ms
C (gcc -O3):       44ms
