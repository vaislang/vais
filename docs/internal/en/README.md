## Design Philosophy

Vais follows these principles:

1. **Small Core + Big Ecosystem** - Keep core minimal, implement most features as libraries
2. **AI-First Design** - Structure that AI can efficiently generate and understand
3. **Token Efficiency** - 30-60% token reduction compared to Python
4. **Functional-First** - Functional programming first approach
