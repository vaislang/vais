# Vais Roadmap

This file tracks current work only.

## Done

- Project path is `/Users/sswoo/study/projects/vais`.
- Checked-in language sources use `.vais`.
- `scripts/vaisc` is the canonical compiler command.
- `tools/vais-check.py` is the canonical lint/error-help command.
- The workspace now exposes only Vais source and Vais commands.
- The compiler gates cover CLI smoke, front-contract diagnostics, direct LLVM emission, parity, and the value corpus.
- The trusted self-host tier is `compiler/self/fixpoint.vais`, `fixpoint2.vais`, `fixpoint3.vais`, and `fixpoint_full.vais`.
- `compiler/self/vaisc_core.ll` is the reusable self-host compiler core used by `scripts/vaisc`.
- The full compiler path reads `.vais` source files directly through the self-host core.
- Pure regeneration of `compiler/self/vaisc_core.ll` from `compiler/self/fixpoint_full.vais` is green.

## Current Reality

- The full compiler path emits LLVM IR through the self-host compiler source in `compiler/self/fixpoint_full.vais`.
- The direct engine is intentionally narrow and currently supports a single `fn main() -> Int { return <Int expr> }` style slice.
- The release compiler command needs Python 3 and clang.
- Internal compiler gates no longer depend on a source pass-through helper.
- Public documentation now starts at `README.md` and `docs/README.md`.
- `docs/reference/LANGUAGE.md` describes only the current gate-backed language surface.
- Local official website source was refreshed and rebuilt from the canonical Vais docs.
- Official site source now lives in `website/` in this repository.
- GitHub Pages workflow was added for `website/` build and artifact deployment.
- `vaislang.dev` is deployed from `gh-pages` using the current `website/dist` output.

## Next Work

1. Decide how to land the current Vais-only history onto the GitHub default branch; the existing remote `main` has older unrelated history.
2. Expand the native direct emitter beyond the current slice: helper calls, locals, control flow, structs, lists, and the trusted self-host tier.
3. Package `scripts/vaisc` as a release command with Python 3 and clang prerequisites.
4. Keep self-host regeneration and parity gates mandatory for compiler changes.

## Verification Baseline

Run before closing compiler changes:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile tools/vaisc.py tools/vais-check.py tools/embed_self_source.py tests/vais_check_test.py
bash -n scripts/*.sh
python3 tests/vais_check_test.py
bash scripts/test-vaisc.sh
bash scripts/test-vaisc-front.sh
bash scripts/test-vaisc-direct.sh
bash scripts/test-vaisc-errors.sh
bash scripts/test-vaisc-parity.sh
bash scripts/test.sh
```
